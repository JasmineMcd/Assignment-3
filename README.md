Grammer - valid statements include
id :== identifier, exp :== expression, op :== operator, char :== character, 
id = exp; , id op id {op id}, id op (id op id) op id AND id op id op (id op id)
each id, op, =, and ; will have a space and addidtional information provided
id made up of digits and chars

Compilation - Compile this file using flex/bison
Files required README, Makefile, Source File, Header File

Issues - Rough estimation of grammer rules, file does however work 

Lessons Learned - I learned how to work Flex/Bison because I usually code in c++
